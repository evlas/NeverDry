## What it does

NeverDry tracks a real-time **soil water deficit** for each irrigation zone. Instead of fixed timers, it calculates exactly how much water your garden has lost through evaporation and how much it got back from rain — then irrigates only when needed, for exactly the right duration.

**Key idea: 1 mm of deficit = 1 liter per m² of water needed.**

## Features

- **Scientific model** — simplified FAO-56 water balance with two calibratable parameters
- **Per-zone crop coefficient (Kc)** — 10 plant families with seasonal variation, auto-adjusted for hemisphere
- **Direct valve control** — opens/closes valves, calculates exact duration, sequential multi-zone
- **Per-zone deficit tracking** — each zone dries out at its own rate based on plant type
- **Rain-aware** — deficit decreases with each rain event, skips irrigation on rainy days
- **Two scheduling modes** — reactive threshold (Mode A) and nightly deficit-based (Mode B)
- **Monitoring mode** — no valves? Get a notification every 6h when irrigation is needed
- **Emergency stop** — instantly closes all valves
- **State persistence** — survives HA restarts via RestoreEntity
- **Seamless updates** — automated releases via GitHub Actions, config entry migration preserves settings across versions
- **UI config flow** — set up entirely from the HA interface
- **Zero dependencies** — pure Python, no external libraries

## Sensors

| Sensor | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `sensor.et_hourly_estimate` | mm/h | Instantaneous evapotranspiration rate |
| `sensor.never_dry` | mm | Reference soil water deficit (Kc=1.0) |
| `sensor.irrigation_<zone>` | L | Per-zone volume with duration, deficit, Kc |

Each zone sensor exposes: `volume_liters`, `duration_s`, `deficit_mm`, `kc`, `plant_family`, `valve`, `irrigating`, and more.

## Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `never_dry.irrigate_zone` | Irrigate one zone: open valve, wait, close, reset zone deficit |
| `never_dry.irrigate_all` | All zones sequentially, then reset all deficits |
| `never_dry.stop` | Emergency stop — close all valves immediately |
| `never_dry.reset` | Reset all deficits to zero |

## Plant Families

Each zone can be assigned a plant family with seasonal Kc values (northern hemisphere — auto-flipped for southern):

| Family | Winter | Spring | Summer | Autumn |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Lawn / Turf grass | 0.45 | 0.85 | 1.00 | 0.70 |
| Vegetables (seasonal) | 0.30 | 0.70 | 1.10 | 0.50 |
| Fruit trees (deciduous) | 0.35 | 0.70 | 0.95 | 0.55 |
| Ornamental shrubs | 0.40 | 0.65 | 0.80 | 0.55 |
| Herbs (Mediterranean) | 0.30 | 0.55 | 0.70 | 0.40 |
| Citrus / Evergreen fruit | 0.60 | 0.65 | 0.70 | 0.65 |
| Roses | 0.35 | 0.75 | 0.95 | 0.55 |
| Succulents / Cacti | 0.15 | 0.25 | 0.35 | 0.20 |
| Native ground cover | 0.25 | 0.45 | 0.55 | 0.35 |
| Mixed garden (default) | 0.40 | 0.70 | 0.90 | 0.55 |

You can also set a **manual Kc override** per zone (0.1–2.0) if you know the exact value.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant
2. Go to **Integrations** > **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/drake69/NeverDry` — category **Integration**
4. Search for **NeverDry** and install
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add Integration** > search **NeverDry**

### Manual

1. Copy `custom_components/never_dry/` into your HA `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration from the UI

---

## Updating

**Via HACS**: HACS notifies you when a new version is available. Click **Update** and restart HA.

**Manual**: Download the latest `never_dry.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/drake69/NeverDry/releases), replace the `custom_components/never_dry/` folder, and restart HA.

Your configuration and sensor history are preserved automatically. If the new version changes the config schema, settings are migrated seamlessly — no need to remove and re-add the integration.

---

## Configuration

NeverDry is configured entirely through the UI — no YAML required.

### Step 1: Sensors and model

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Temperature sensor | Yes | — | Outdoor temperature [°C] |
| Rain sensor | Yes | — | Precipitation sensor [mm] |
| Rain sensor type | No | event | `event` (mm per event, tipping bucket) or `daily_total` (cumulative mm since midnight) |
| Alpha (α) | No | 0.22 | ET coefficient [mm/°C/day] |
| Base temperature | No | 9.0 | Below this, ET = 0 [°C] |
| Max deficit (D_max) | No | 100.0 | Upper clamp [mm] |
| VWC sensor | No | — | Soil moisture (bypasses ET model) |

### Step 2: Irrigation zones

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Zone name | Yes | — | Display name |
| Valve | No | — | Switch entity controlling the valve (omit for monitoring mode) |
| Area | Yes | — | Irrigated area [m²] |
| System type | Yes | — | Drip / micro-sprinkler / sprinkler / manual |
| Efficiency | No | (from type) | Override distribution efficiency [0.1–1.0] |
| Plant family | No | — | Sets seasonal Kc profile |
| Custom Kc | No | — | Override Kc [0.1–2.0] |
| Flow rate | Yes | — | Valve flow rate [L/min] |
| Threshold | No | 20.0 | Mode A trigger [mm] |

## Scientific Background

Based on the FAO-56 water balance (Allen et al., 1998):

```
D_zone(t) = clamp(D_zone(t-1) + ET_h × Kc × Δt − ΔP,  0,  D_max)

ET_h = max(0, α × (T − T_base) / 24)     [mm/h]  evapotranspiration
Kc   = f(day_of_year, plant_family)        [—]     crop coefficient
ΔP   = rain_delta(sensor_type)             [mm]    precipitation increment
V    = D_zone × Area / Efficiency          [L]     volume needed
t    = V / FlowRate × 60                   [s]     irrigation duration
```

**Key design choices:**
- Integration is event-driven (forward Euler, variable Δt) — no fixed polling interval
- Each zone tracks its own deficit scaled by Kc, not a shared global value
- Rain is always processed as a **delta** (increment since last reading), not a raw value — this correctly handles both tipping-bucket sensors (mm per event) and cumulative daily-total sensors (mm since midnight)

## Disclaimer

NeverDry is a **hobby project for residential use**. It is not certified for agricultural, commercial, or safety-critical applications. The authors accept no liability for crop damage, water waste, property damage, or any other loss resulting from the use of this software.

The ET model is a simplification of the FAO-56 standard and is **not a substitute for professional agronomic advice**. Crop coefficients (Kc) are approximate seasonal averages for typical residential plants — actual water needs depend on soil type, microclimate, plant health, and many other factors.

**Always monitor your irrigation system** and verify that valves open and close correctly. Use the emergency stop service (`never_dry.stop`) if anything goes wrong.
